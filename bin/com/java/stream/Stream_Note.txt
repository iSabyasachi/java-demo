Stream In Java

1. Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects.

2. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be 
pipelined to produce the desired result.

3. The features :
	i) A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, 
	Arrays or I/O channels.
	
	ii) Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result
	as per the pipelined methods.
	
	iii)Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, 
	hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the 
	end of the stream and return the result. 

4. Intermediate Operations:
	i) map, filter , sorted etc
5. Terminal Operations:
	ii) collect, forEach, reduce
